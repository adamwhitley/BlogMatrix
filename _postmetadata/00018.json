    meta_description: "How I went about producing my first SaaS product, Quality Indicators Pro.",
    summary: 
"
In 2010 I co-founded a SaaS product called <a href='http://www.qualityindicatorspro.com.au/' target='_blank'>Quality Indicators Pro</a>. I learnt a ton of things during this time both from a technical point of view all the way through to
        marketing and sales. As usual with most developers who build a product it started with me 'scratching my itch'.
