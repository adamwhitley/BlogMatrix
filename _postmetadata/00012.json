    summary: 
"
Up to this point my blog engine has been working quite nicely; however, it does lack one key feature: an RSS feed. 
Without support for RSS people will have to continually come back to my website to check for new posts. That's not likely to occur :( 
So let's fix this and get an RSS feed up and running!
