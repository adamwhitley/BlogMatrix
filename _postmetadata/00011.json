    summary: 
"
<p class='lead'>Developing software is a rather complex task. Ask any developer. It's made even harder by the three competing goals of software development: Time, Money and Features.</p>
<p>In an ideal world every software development project would be delivered on time, within budget and with all the features originally requested. Unfortunately this is very rarely the case.</p>
